I am Prabal Poudel, a Ph.D student at INKA, chair of Catheter Technologies and Image Guided Therapies under Prof. Michael Friebe at Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg. I completed my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Jacobs University Bremen. I also got an opportunity to go to Washington State University for a semester as a part of my semester exchange program where I specialized in Computer Science by taking courses from Artificial Intelligence, Computer Graphics, Computer Networks, and Protocols. Then, I moved to the University of Bonn for my Masters in Computer Science. I worked in "3D Segmentation of Thyroid Ultrasound Images using Active Contours" as a part of my Master's Thesis at INKA which was funded by General Electrics. Currently, I am involved in analyzing the biomedical images (ultrasound/endoscopy) by using machine learning algorithms and neural networks.
