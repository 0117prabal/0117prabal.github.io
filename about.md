I am Prabal Poudel, a Ph.D student at <a href="http://www.inka-md.de/">INKA</a>, chair of Catheter Technologies and Image Guided Therapies under Prof. Michael Friebe at <a href="https://www.ovgu.de/">Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg</a>. I completed my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from <a href="https://www.jacobs-university.de/">Jacobs University Bremen</a>. I also got an opportunity to go to <a href="https://wsu.edu/">Washington State University</a> for a semester as a part of my semester exchange program where I specialized in Computer Science by taking courses from Artificial Intelligence, Computer Graphics, Computer Networks, and Protocols. Then, I moved to the <a href="https://www.uni-bonn.de/">University of Bonn</a> for my Masters in Computer Science. I worked in "3D Segmentation of Thyroid Ultrasound Images using Active Contours" as a part of my Master's Thesis at INKA which was funded by <a href="https://www.ge.com/">General Electrics</a>. Currently, I am involved in analyzing the biomedical images (ultrasound/endoscopy) by using machine learning algorithms and neural networks.
